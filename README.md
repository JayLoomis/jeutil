# jeutil
A barebones, 2D, tile-based game engine for HTML 5.

## What is this, and why?

I want to make some games using HTML 5 and JavaScript. There are lots of engines out there, but they
all have their own angles and perspectives. What I want is something simpler that packages common
things into APIs. Jeutil (French: Jeu [game] + Outil [tool]) is meant to do just what I need it to
without requiring buying into a completely new paradigm.

## Modules

### Maps

### Images

### Spritesheets

Yeah, I know that not all files with images in them are properly spritesheets, but I'm pretty sure I
can deal.

### GameObjects

#### Actors

#### Interactables

#### Passives
